Basic algorithms and data structures.

Sorting Dates Input:

In the first line: the number of elements of the input set (N).
In the next N lines: dates to sort (format dd-mm-yyyy).

Heap Commands:

'v': add a number v to the heap
'-': remove the maximum from the max heap (minimum from the min heap respectively) and write it on the screen
'p': write all elements of the heap in the order in which they are stored in an array
'r': n v1 ...vn (remove all elements from the heap and create a heap out of n new elements, of the values given by v1 ...vn)'
's': change the orientation of the heap â€“ from max to min or from min to max; s operation can be requested multiple times
'q': exit the program

Hashtable input:

The text (any number of words with only lower case letters, separated by spaces or new line characters). The words starting with character '?' and '-', and the word "q"  are interpreted as commands:

'?': print the number of occurences of the given word on the screen,
'-': remove the information about the given word from the hash table
'q': exit.
